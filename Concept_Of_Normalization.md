# Understanding the Concept of Normalization in DBMS

Normalization is a systematic approach to organizing data in a database. It helps reduce redundancy and avoid common anomalies like insertion, update, and deletion issues. Normalization decomposes complex tables into simpler, well-structured ones to enhance data integrity.

## Why Normalize?

Without normalization, databases can suffer from:

- **Redundancy**: Repeated data wastes storage and leads to inconsistencies.
- **Update Anomalies**: Inconsistent updates if data appears in multiple places.
- **Insertion Anomalies**: Inability to insert data due to missing associated data.
- **Deletion Anomalies**: Unintended loss of data due to deletions.

## Types of Anomalies

1. **Insertion Anomaly**  
   Can't insert a value into a table without having to insert unrelated data.

2. **Update Anomaly**  
   Requires multiple updates when data is repeated.

3. **Deletion Anomaly**  
   Deleting one record leads to loss of additional data.

## Normal Forms

Normalization is carried out in stages called **Normal Forms** (NF), each solving specific issues.

---

### First Normal Form (1NF)

**Criteria**:

- Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values.
- Each record is unique.

**Example – Not in 1NF**:

| StudentID | Name | Subjects      |
| --------- | ---- | ------------- |
| 101       | John | Math, Physics |

**Converted to 1NF**:

| StudentID | Name | Subject |
| --------- | ---- | ------- |
| 101       | John | Math    |
| 101       | John | Physics |

---

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Criteria**:

- In 1NF.
- No partial dependency (i.e., non-key attributes depend on full primary key).

**Problem Table**:

| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName | CourseName |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------- |

- `StudentName` depends only on `StudentID`.
- `CourseName` depends only on `CourseID`.

**Split into**:

- `Students(StudentID, StudentName)`
- `Courses(CourseID, CourseName)`
- `Enrollments(StudentID, CourseID)`

---

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Criteria**:

- In 2NF.
- No transitive dependency (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes).

**Problem Table**:

| StudentID | StudentName | Department | HOD |

- `HOD` depends on `Department`, which depends on `StudentID`.

**Split into**:

- `Students(StudentID, StudentName, Department)`
- `Departments(Department, HOD)`

---

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

**Criteria**:

- For every functional dependency `X → Y`, `X` must be a super key.

BCNF handles edge cases not covered by 3NF.

---

## Higher Normal Forms

- **4NF**: Eliminates multi-valued dependencies.
- **5NF**: Deals with join dependencies.

These are used in highly complex data models.

## Summary Table

| Normal Form | Key Condition                        | Eliminates              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1NF         | Atomic values                        | Repeating groups        |
| 2NF         | Full functional dependency           | Partial dependency      |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependency             | Transitive dependency   |
| BCNF        | Every determinant is a candidate key | Remaining 3NF anomalies |

Normalization ensures better database design, consistency, and maintainability. However, excessive normalization can hurt performance, so a balance is always needed depending on the use case.
