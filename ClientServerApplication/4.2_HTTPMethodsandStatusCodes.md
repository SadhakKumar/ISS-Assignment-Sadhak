# 4.2 HTTP Methods and Status Codes

## HTTP Methods

HTTP defines several request methods that indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource.

## 1. GET

## 2. POST

- **Purpose:** Send new data to the server.
- **Used For:** Creating or submitting resources such as forms or new entries.

## HTTP Status Codes

Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client’s request made to the server. They indicate whether a request has been successfully completed or if there was an error.

## Summary

- Use **GET** to retrieve data, **POST** to send data, and **PUT/DELETE** to modify/delete resources.
- HTTP status codes help understand whether the request was successful or why it failed.
- Understanding these methods and codes is crucial for debugging and designing robust client-server communication in web applications.
